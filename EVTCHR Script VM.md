# EVTCHR Script VM

The per-unit animation script VM: `FUN_80084818` is a bytecode interpreter (not an anim_id → frame lookup) that arms a unit's body frame `+0x1dc` for EVTCHR animations — 66 control opcodes (0xbe..0xff) dispatched through the switch table at `0x80067f20`, with scripts selected from runtime-populated tables (`0x800A77D8` for anim IDs 0x1F4..0x257, `0x800AED3C` for 0x258+) and each script a two-bytes-per-entry stream of frame-step entries and control opcodes. Decoded 2026-06-27 from the disassembly and validated against a live RAM dump of the chapel script table: the chapel exercises exactly 2 of the 66 control opcodes (LOOP + EMIT-AND-YIELD), and the scripts are shared-suffix tails in one bytecode blob at `0x800AEE44`.

## Points

- **`FUN_80084818` is a bytecode interpreter (not an anim_id → frame lookup) with 66 control opcodes (`0xbe..0xff`) dispatched via the switch table at `0x80067f20`: its dispatch loop (`0x800848d0..0x80084930`) consumes two bytes per entry — `byte_A ≠ 0xff` is a frame-step (emit `frame_id = unit+0x14 + byte_A`, set `duration = byte_B + unit+0x12`, call `FUN_80084214`, yield) while `byte_A == 0xff` dispatches control opcode `0x80067f20[byte_B − 0xbe]`; most control cases loop back to `LAB_800848d0` without yielding (`caseD_c2`), only `caseD_ff` exits (`LAB_80085200`).** — `[S·D] 2/3`
  - S: `0x800848d0..0x80084930` (dispatch loop), `0x80067f20` (switch table) (`battle_disassembly.txt` @ 0x80084818..0x800851fc)
  - D: probe `probe_layer4_render.lua` 30 s hit table (2026-06-27): 60 fires during the chapel cinematic
  - src: `research/working_documents/chapel_opcode_trace/SPRITE_PIPELINE_INVESTIGATION.md`
- **The script table is selected by anim ID: `< 0x1F4` → the unit's own slot table (`lw 0x20(s5)`), `0x1F4..0x257` → `0x800A77D8`, `≥ 0x258` → `0x800AED3C` with `s4 = anim_id − 0x258` and the script pointer read at `lw 0x8(v0)` — a base-minus-8 convention, so the effective pointer array starts at `0x800AED44`; an entry of `−1` fires the on-demand load stub `SUB_80044a08`.** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: `0x80084850..0x800848b8` (table selection + `lw 0x8(v0)`), `0x800A77D8`, `0x800AED3C`/`0x800AED44`, `SUB_80044a08` (`battle_disassembly.txt`)
  - src: `research/working_documents/chapel_opcode_trace/SPRITE_PIPELINE_INVESTIGATION.md`
- **Both script tables are runtime-populated (neither has a static initialiser in BATTLE.BIN) — filled by event opcodes (0x58 Load EVTCHR and the deferred-loader dispatcher at `0x80143790`) from the loaded EVTCHR.BIN image; in the chapel savestate `0x800A77D8` is all-zero (the 0x1F4..0x257 band unused) and `0x800AED3C..43` is zero-initialised filler with a 16-byte preamble at `0x800AED34`.** — `[S·D] 2/3`

- **Per-unit VM state (u16 fields on the unit struct): `+0x4` anim_id (script selector), `+0x6` PC (script-relative byte offset), `+0x8` cached last-emit frame_id, `+0xa` current target duration (`byte_B + unit+0x12`, clamped to 0x100, cleared by `caseD_ff`), `+0xc` loop counter (incremented by `caseD_d5`), `+0x12` duration-base accumulator, `+0x14` base frame (delta-additive: emit = base + byte_A) — and the script's emit is one indirection from `+0x1dc`: the script computes `s0 = unit+0x14 + byte_A`, passes it to `FUN_80084214`, which writes `+0x1dc`.** — `[S] 1/3`

- **The chapel EVTCHR scripts are shared-suffix tails in one bytecode blob at `0x800AEE44`: consecutive anim IDs point 4 or 6 bytes further into the same blob (anim N+1 = the suffix of anim N, dropping one frame-step entry or one frame-step + control entry from the front), and every script tail-ends in the common `ff d5 ff ff` sequence.** — `[D] 1/3`
