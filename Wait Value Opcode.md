# Wait Value Opcode

Event instruction `0x7E` Wait Value (`7E vv vv nn nn`, 5 bytes) is the event VM's write-then-poll variable barrier: it blocks the fiber until the named variable reaches `>= value` (signed), re-polling by cooperatively yielding the fiber each frame — it neither writes the variable nor busy-waits, so an overshooting counter still releases. The static decode (2026-06-30) pins the handler as `FUN_8014a3f8` (Ghidra mislabels it `evt0x7f_evtchr_palette_handler` — an attribution now CONTESTED by the master catalog, which assigns `0x8014a3f8` to `0x7F` EVTCHR Palette) and establishes that Wait Value is the *real* consumer of var 87 in the Orbonne prayer scene — a free-running frame-timing counter reset to 0 by `Zero(87); Add(87,0)` and polled at frames 28/30 to schedule the two altar rotations. The compare/jump family (`0xA0`–`0xA5`, `0xD0`–`0xD5`) is fully present in the engine but is never executed in the scenario chunks we own. The live write-BP on the resolved address (2026-06-30) nailed the per-frame producer: every var 87 write in the prayer scene comes from the event VM's own `Zero(87); Add(87, k)` pairs at the word-path writeback `0x8014a2b4`.

## Points

- **Event instruction `0x7E` Wait Value is a 5-byte write-then-poll barrier — `7E vv vv nn nn` = `Wait Value(variable, value)` (catalog `event_opcodes.json`) — handled by `FUN_8014a3f8`, dispatched at `0x80145af4` (which actually tests `0x7E`; the Ghidra label `evt0x7f_evtchr_palette_handler` is a delay-slot mislabel, the `ori 0x7f` stages the *next* comparison) and again from the secondary table at `0x8013e9ec`.** — `[S] 1/3 CONTESTED`
  - S: handler `FUN_8014a3f8`, dispatch `0x80145af4`, secondary table `0x8013e9ec` (`project-assets/fft-rom/battle_disassembly.txt`); encoding per `event_opcodes.json` catalog
  - ⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-08-19) by: No longer CONTESTED, and no delay-slot argument is needed — reading the interpreter's comparison chain mechanically gives `0x7E` a **wait** body at `0x80145afc` that calls `FUN_8014a3f8`, and `0x7F` a **separate** body at `0x80145b14` that calls `0x80133158` and `0x8008dac0`; the two opcodes have distinct case bodies, so `FUN_8014a3f8` is Wait Value's handler and the EVTCHR-palette work is the other body's
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instruction_a0_d5_variable_readers.md`
- **The master catalog instead assigns `0x8014a3f8` to `0x7F` EVTCHR Palette (Unit:2, Block:1, Palette:1): `0x8014a3f8` (`evt0x7f_evtchr_palette_handler`) is a timing-wait on `FUN_8013b590(Block) >= Palette`, i.e. it reads the function as the {7F} handler rather than the {7E} Wait Value handler.** — `[S] 1/3 CONTESTED`
  - S: `0x8014a3f8` (`evt0x7f_evtchr_palette_handler`), `FUN_8013b590` (master catalog `EventCommands.xml` row {7F})
  - ⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-08-19) by: The master catalog's attribution is the wrong half of the pair — `0x7F`'s own case body is at `0x80145b14` and calls `0x80133158`/`0x8008dac0`, not `FUN_8014a3f8`
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instructions.md`
- **Wait Value blocks the fiber until `var[id] >= value` (signed `>=`, not `==`): it reads the variable via `FUN_8013b590`, compares with `slt`, and while below the threshold cooperatively yields the fiber (`event_fiber_yield`, `0x8014ca80`) and re-polls next frame — it does not write the variable and does not busy-wait, so a counter that *overshoots* the threshold still releases (matters for a faithful port).** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: poll loop `0x8014a428`–`0x8014a444` (var read via `jal FUN_8013b590` at `0x8014a428`, `slt` at `0x8014a430`, `beq` exit at `0x8014a434`, `event_fiber_yield` `0x8014ca80`, re-poll `j` at `0x8014a444`) (`battle_disassembly.txt`)
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instruction_a0_d5_variable_readers.md`
- **In the Orbonne prayer scene, var 87 is a free-running frame-timing counter: `Zero(87)` at scenario_1 chunk offset 1863 and `Add(87,0)` at 1866 reset it to 0 as the sync point, then the parallel block spawned at 1871 (`2A` Block Start) polls `Wait Value(87,28)` at 1872 and `Wait Value(87,30)` at 1884 to fire the two altar rotations (Rotate Unit at 1877/1889) at frames 28/30 — a timing-sync mechanism, not a conditional branch; `scenario_0001_setup` uses the identical idiom.** — `[D] 1/3`
  - D: `scenario_1_chunk.json` + `scenario_0001_setup_chunk.json` byte-grounded against the real scenario chunks (2026-06-30)
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instruction_a0_d5_variable_readers.md`
- **Neither `scenario_1` nor `scenario_0001_setup` executes a single `0xA0`–`0xA5` comparison or `0xD0`–`0xD5` jump — every such byte that can be grepped out of those chunks lives in the mis-decoded dialog-text region past `_text_offset` (2297) — so the only reader of var 87 in the scenarios we own is `0x7E` Wait Value, never the comparison/jump family.** — `[D] 1/3`
  - D: `scenario_1_chunk.json` + `scenario_0001_setup_chunk.json` byte-grounded against the real scenario chunks (2026-06-30)
  - ⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-08-19) by: True of these two chunks and not of the shipped scripts — the comparison/jump family does execute. Statically, 14 of the 304 scripted slots use control flow; slot 421 alone holds 30 forward jumps, 15 backward, 15 comparisons and 381 variable ops, and every one of the 55 forward and 21 backward jumps in the corpus resolves (0 do not)
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instruction_a0_d5_variable_readers.md`
- **`FUN_8013b590` is the resolver-mediated event-variable read (base = `*0x80165f9c`): only var `0x22` is special-cased inside it (to a camera angle), var `0x57` (87) takes the generic read path, and the read is read-only (it mirrors var 87 into scratch var 0).** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: `FUN_8013b590` (called at `0x8014a428`), base pointer `*0x80165f9c` (`battle_disassembly.txt`)
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instruction_a0_d5_variable_readers.md`
- **The per-frame producer of var 87 is the prayer scene's own `Zero(87); Add(87, k)` idiom: a write breakpoint on the resolved address `0x80057878` (Orbonne prayer scene, female-knight-held-by-Simon savestate, advanced by real CIRCLE taps) captured 300 writes — every one at the event VM's word-path writeback `pc=0x8014a2b4`, in strict `ZERO → ADD` pairs ~820 cycles apart (counter climbs 634→658, resets, then 0,1,2,…,124) — so no store outside the event VM drives it.** — `[S·D] 2/3`
  - S: `0x8014a2b4` (`_sw s0, 0x0(s5)` word-path writeback inside `FUN_8014a018`) (`battle_disassembly.txt`)
  - D: write-BP capture on `0x80057878`, `research/working_documents/scenario_1_captures/last_run/var87_zero_add_live.log` — 300 writes, strict ZERO→ADD pairs (2026-06-30)
  - src: `research/wiki_articles/event_instruction_b0_be_variable_math.md`
- **The comparison and jump families do run in shipped scripts — 14 of the 304 scripted slots use control flow, and slot 421 alone holds 30 forward jumps, 15 backward jumps, 15 comparisons and 381 variable ops — so a `ScenarioVM` that never exercises them is a coverage artefact of owning 2 chunks, not a property of the game.** — `[S·D] 2/3`
  - S: static walk over all 304 slots of `EVENT/TEST.EVT`: **55 forward and 21 backward jumps resolve, 0 do not**. Three details a port needs: `EventLabelSearch` scanning forward matches `0xD2` (and `0xD4` as well, for `0xD0`), is bounded by `0xDB`, and answers **two past** the match; scanning backward (`0xD3`) it does not walk backwards at all but sweeps forward from `fp` 0 to the jump's own position keeping the **last** `0xD5` carrying the label, with a `0xD9` — or a `0xD2` carrying the same label — discarding whatever it had found; and `0xD0` jumps when event variable 0 is **zero**, while the comparison family writes 1 for true, so `0xD0` is "jump if the test failed"
  - D: a shadow interpreter run beside the emulated game over slot 421 scored 10/10 jumps, 6/6 compares, 63/63 variable ops (web-psx `docs/event-seam.md` [event.jumps], [event.hle.jumps]; cross-referenced 2026-08-19)

- **Event variable `0x21` is a generator rather than a cell: reading it runs the kernel PRNG (`seed*25173 + 13849` masked to 16 bits, the ZX Spectrum constants, at `0x80173c7c`), reachable only through the odd half of the `0xB0` family — so a model that stores `0x21` agrees on the first read and drifts from the second.** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: `BATTLE.BIN+e348c`; this vault's note on the same resolver records only `0x22` as special-cased, so either an id is off by one or the routine has two special cases — the falsifier is to read `0x21` twice in a row and see whether the value changes (2026-08-19)
