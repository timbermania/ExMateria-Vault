# Particle Curve Indices

Spawn-time behaviour of the emitter's packed curve indices, resolved in the particle spawn routine FUN_801a60ac: each nibble of emitter bytes 0x08–0x0F indexes an entry in the per-effect animation-curve table (0xA0-byte entries; the interpolation factor is the byte at entry_base + anim_frame + 4), and the selected curve lerps the matching emitter start/end field pair into a specific particle field — per-frame spawn count (0xB0/0xB2), spawn center (via FUN_801a8c14 → particle +0x0C–0x14), spread (via FUN_801a8c8c → ±rand scatter), velocity base angle (via FUN_801a8d04 → rotation matrix), velocity-direction cone (0x38–0x43), radial velocity (0x5C–0x63), acceleration (0x64–0x7B → +0x24–0x2C), drag (0x7C–0x93 → +0x30–0x38), lifetime (0x94–0x9A → +0x42), and target/homing offset (0x9C–0xA6 → +0x3C–0x40 with anchor-mode base offsets) — with per-particle randomization between the lerped bounds. The high nibble of byte 0x0F carries two 2-bit fields: a homing-strength curve index (low 2 bits) and a direct homing-curve index (high 2 bits, copied to +0x45 without a lerp).

## Points

- **Each emitter curve resolves against the per-effect animation-curve table (effect_anim_tbl_ptr, global 0x801BBF7C ← header anim_table_ptr): the per-frame interpolation factor for curve index N is the byte at `table_base + N * 0xA0 + anim_frame + 4` — a 0xA0-byte entry per curve, with per-frame bytes following a 4-byte header.** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: interpolation-factor fetch in the spawn routine FUN_801a60ac (`anim_index * 0xa0 + effect_anim_tbl_ptr + anim_frame + 4`), per `research/working_documents/CURVE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - src: `research/working_documents/CURVE_ANALYSIS.md`
- **The particle-count curve (high nibble of emitter byte 0x0E) lerps particle_count_start (0xB0) toward particle_count_end (0xB2) by the interpolation factor, and the result is the number of particles spawned that frame — each allocated via FUN_801a5c3c in a loop.** — `[S] 1/3`

  - src: `research/working_documents/CURVE_ANALYSIS.md`
- **The spawn-position curve (low nibble of emitter byte 0x08) is resolved by FUN_801a8c14(emitter, factor, &out), which writes the interpolated spawn-center position into the particle's 12.12 position (+0x0C/+0x10/+0x14).** — `[S] 1/3`

- **The radial-velocity curve (high nibble of emitter byte 0x0B) lerps radial_velocity_min (0x5C→0x60) and radial_velocity_max (0x5E→0x62); each particle then gets a random value in [min, max) (min itself when min == max), 0 = straight-line motion and larger values = wider spirals; it only takes effect while the velocity-mode flag 0x400 (SKIP) is clear, and it controls radial (outward) spread rather than vertical motion.** — `[S] 1/3`
