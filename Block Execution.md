# Block Execution

The event VM runs parallel `Block Start`/`Block End` (0x2A/0x2B) brackets as genuine cooperative coroutines on a 16-slot fixed-stack scheduler: `Block Start` allocates a free slot, runs a generic block-body interpreter (`FUN_8013e904`) over the bracket's bytes, and the main thread skips its own pointer past the matching `Block End`; `Block End` only terminates the block's own coroutine and never synchronizes the main thread. The static model (LAB_80144e70, FUN_8014ca80, FUN_80149ebc in battle_disassembly.txt) was confirmed bit-for-bit by a live PCSX-Redux run in the chapel scenario (2026-06-27), where three parallel walk-on blocks entered slots 3/4/5 in the same vsync as their `Block Start`s.

## Points

- **FFT/PSX runs parallel `Block Start`/`Block End` (0x2A/0x2B) brackets as genuine cooperative coroutines — block contents execute interleaved with the main thread from the same vsync as `Block Start`, and `Block End` merely terminates the block's own coroutine (`FUN_8014c958`) without synchronizing the main thread.** — `[S·D] 2/3`

  - src: `research/working_documents/chapel_opcode_trace/BLOCK_EXECUTION_INVESTIGATION.md`
- **`Block Start` (0x2A) allocates a free slot (1..15) via `FUN_80149bec(0x10)`, initializes that slot's coroutine with the generic block-body interpreter `FUN_8013e904` via `FUN_8014c8a0`, plants the byte right after the 0x2A as the slot's bytecode pointer, and then has the main thread fast-forward its own pointer past the matching 0x2B via `FUN_80149ebc`.** — `[S·D] 2/3`

  - D: live probe — three back-to-back `Block Start`s at vsync 409 allocated slots 3/4/5 and planted byte pointers 0x8004A8FE/0x8004A94E/0x8004A997, exactly matching static chapel chunk base 0x8004A6BC + offset + 1 (`static_chunk.tsv` cross-check) (2026-06-27)
  - ⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-08-19) by: The forward scan does not end the instruction — `FUN_80149ebc` writes `fp` and then **falls into the advance tail**, which adds `1 + width[opcode]` on top with the register still holding the *skipping* opcode (`0x2A`, width 0), so the main thread lands one byte past the matching `0x2B` rather than on it. Two further properties of that routine: it matches on the opcode alone and answers the offset **of** the match rather than past it, and it answers **0** when it meets `0xDB`, which puts `fp` back on the slot's four-byte header
  - src: `research/working_documents/chapel_opcode_trace/BLOCK_EXECUTION_INVESTIGATION.md`
- **The scheduler is a 16-slot fixed-stack cooperative design: the slot table lives at 0x8016986C (via `DAT_80165f98`) with 0x400-byte slots, the current slot index is `DAT_80174038` (0x10 wraps to 0), and `FUN_8014ca80` saves s0..s7/k0/k1/gp/sp/s8/ra to slot+0x10..0x44, round-robins to the next live slot (alive flag slot+0x48) running the per-tick engine `FUN_80142ca8` between swaps — every blocking opcode handler yields in a loop via `FUN_8014ca80` until its wait condition clears.** — `[S·D] 2/3`
  - S: `DAT_80165f98` → 0x8016986C, `DAT_80174038`, `FUN_8014ca80`, `FUN_80142ca8` (`project-assets/fft-rom/battle_disassembly.txt`)

- **The generic block-body interpreter `FUN_8013e904` dispatches opcodes from its slot's bytecode pointer, advancing by `DAT_8014d170[opcode]+1`, and exits on 0x2B by calling `FUN_8014c958`; its opcode handlers yield themselves (e.g. `FUN_8013e7d0` busy-waits until a Unit Anim finishes), so a block ticks at whatever rate its own wait conditions allow.** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: `FUN_8013e904`–`0x8013edd4` (dispatch loop LAB_8013e95c, epilogue LAB_8013ed80), `FUN_8013e7d0` (`project-assets/fft-rom/battle_disassembly.txt`)
  - src: `research/working_documents/chapel_opcode_trace/BLOCK_EXECUTION_INVESTIGATION.md`
- **Among the main interpreter's spawn-coroutine opcodes, `Block Start` (0x2A) is the only one that runs the generic bytecode interpreter `FUN_8013e904`; the others (0x21 SoundEffect → `FUN_8013c710`, 0x2E Wait → `FUN_8014703c`, 0x3B SpriteMove → `FUN_8014672c`, 0x6E SpriteMove(β) → `FUN_80146ee4`, 0x6F WaitSpriteMove → `FUN_80146f20`) each run a hand-written per-opcode coroutine, which is why in-block opcodes like Wait Walk dispatch to the same handler the main thread would use.** — `[S] 1/3`

- **Live slot observation: slot 0 is the always-on system slot, the scenario VM runs on slot 1 (parked on a Wait with wait flag 0x4c=68 in the dump), slot 2 is a long-lived worker, and dead block slots retain their last bytecode pointer because `FUN_8014c958` clears only the alive (0x48) and wait (0x4c) flags, not slot[0].** — `[S·D] 2/3`

- **The opcode-size table at `DAT_8014d170` gives [0x2A Block Start]=0 and [0x2B Block End]=0 (each advances 1 byte), [0x28 Walk To]=8, [0x29 Wait Walk]=2, [0x2D Rotate Unit]=6, [0x2F Block Loop]=0 — so the main thread's forward scan for 0x2B steps over any nested 0x2A one byte at a time with no depth tracking.** — `[S·D] 2/3`

- **`allocate_task_slot(n)` is not an allocator: it returns `n` unchanged whenever `n < 16`, so a script names the slot its fiber goes in and the free-slot scan is only the fallback for a hint of 16 or more — a VM that always allocates scores 100% until the first script that does not use the hint.** — `[S] 1/3`
  - S: `Display Message` hands the routine its own first parameter byte; a second allocator, which scans *upward from the running slot*, exists and has exactly two callers, `0x3B` and `0x6E` (web-psx `docs/event-seam.md` [event.hle.found]) (2026-08-19)

- **`0xDB` is not a stop and chains: it re-reads event variable `0x27`, and jumps to the interpreter's top when `LoadNextEvent` returns non-zero — measured, event 2 chains to 4 and then to 5 off one entry — and `fp` 0 is the slot's four-byte header, whose four `0xF2` bytes dispatch as four one-byte no-ops on every chain.** — `[S·D] 2/3`
  - S: an event is a slot index 0..499 of `EVENT/TEST.EVT` at LBA `3707 + 4n`, started by writing event variable `0x27`; `WORLD.BIN` carries its own copy of the variable machinery and advances the story by incrementing the same variable
